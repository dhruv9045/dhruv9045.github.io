							"The fields of Computer Science, Information Technology, Electronics & Telecommunication and Applied Electronics & Instrumentation are growing at an exponential rate due to digitization and automation of the Industries and offices worldwide.
							Whether it be developing the application for your smart phone, creating new healthcare devices to improve lives, using the power of computers to analyze genomes, devising the next level of cyber security to help protect sensitive information, development of robots, drones, Internet of things (IoT) and doing projects for smart cities, the Departments of CS, IT, ET & AEI provide our students with the tools they need to be industry leaders. The future will be filled with advances that are only in our wildest imagination, but those dreams will become a reality thanks to the research and design happening at departments.
							Adding to the exciting future of the departments, we provide advance learning in Cloud Computing, Big Data, IoT, Business Intelligence, High Performance Computing, Graphics & Animation, Digital Marketing, Machine Learning, Web & App Development, Embedded, PLC, and Robotics. These advanced learning programs are built for the future of engineering instead of just being an adaption of the engineering of the past. Its focus will be on the small-scale and mobile technologies that will advance the Internet of Things and lead us into the future. Our programs will provide the educational background you need to help you reach your goals.
							The future is now, and it is brighter than ever. I invite you to learn more about our transformative engineering programs and the many opportunities that the COER provides. Please join us on this journey."
